/**
 * Netlify Scheduled Function — `/.netlify/functions/refresh-dataset-scheduled`
 *
 * v5.2 periodic-refresh endpoint. Triggered by a cron schedule
 * configured in `netlify.toml`. The schedule is "every 30
 * minutes" (the actual cron string lives in `netlify.toml`,
 * not here — see `[functions.refresh-dataset-scheduled]
 * schedule = ...` in that file). Avoiding the literal cron
 * expression in this comment is intentional: the comment
 * terminator sequence inside a JS block comment would close
 * the doc early and the rest would parse as code (v5.2.2
 * deploy fix).
 *
 * Why a separate scheduled function (not the same handler as
 * the manual endpoint):
 *   - Scheduled functions receive a different event shape
 *     (no `Request`, no `context.waitUntil`); the handler
 *     signature is `(event) => Response | undefined`.
 *   - Keeping the two entry points separate lets each one
 *     log its trigger source clearly ("scheduled" vs "manual")
 *     and lets the scheduled path run without an HTTP
 *     context (no headers, no status codes — it just runs).
 *
 * Conservative cadence:
 *   Every 30 minutes; configured in `netlify.toml`. The task
 *   spec calls for "a conservative interval first, such as
 *   hourly or every 30 minutes" — 30 min chosen so the
 *   public demo gets a fresh dataset twice per hour without
 *   hammering the upstream feeds. The v5.0.1 CDN cache
 *   (`s-maxage=900` = 15 min) is still in place, so visitors
 *   within a 15-min window hit the cached response either
 *   way; the schedule just refreshes the blob so the NEXT
 *   visitor after the cache expires gets a fresh build.
 *
 * Lock interaction:
 *   The scheduled function uses the same `runRefresh`
 *   orchestrator as the manual endpoint. If a manual refresh
 *   is already in progress (lock held), the scheduled run
 *   returns `{ status: 'in-progress' }` without starting a
 *   duplicate build. The next scheduled tick will retry.
 *
 * Flow (mirrors `refresh-dataset-background.mjs`):
 *   1. Acquire the refresh-lock blob.
 *   2. If already held: return early (the manual endpoint
 *      will finish it).
 *   3. Otherwise: run CISA → NVD → EPSS.
 *   4. On success: write to `latest-dataset`, release lock.
 *   5. On failure: release lock, leave existing blob intact.
