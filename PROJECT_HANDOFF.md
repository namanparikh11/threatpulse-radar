# PROJECT_HANDOFF

> Handoff note for **ThreatPulse Radar**.
> Covers the filter / search / sort overhaul, the data-cleanup pass, and
> the hero/header redesign.

---

## TL;DR

The first pass shipped a working dashboard, but the filter / sort UX had
real problems:

- The table kept its **own** internal sort state, which silently disagreed
  with the page-level sort → "sorting doesn't work."
- The search haystack didn't include `severity` and `source`, so searches
  like "CISA" or "Critical" returned nothing.
- The mock dataset had **3 duplicate CVE IDs** (21626, 21893, 22245) and
  rows were keyed by `cveId`, so duplicates collided in React's keys.
- No internal `id` field. No debounced search. No spinner / "X of Y"
  feedback. No clear-X inside the search box.

This pass addresses all of that. Build passes, no console errors, the
search pipeline is single-sourced in a custom hook.

---

## What changed (by file)

### Types
- **`src/types/vulnerability.ts`** — major rewrite
  - Added `id: string` to `Vulnerability` (stable, always unique).
  - Replaced the old `SortKey` enum with `SortField` + `SortDirection`
    + `SortState = { field, direction }`.
  - Removed `sortBy` from `VulnerabilityFilters` (sort is now a sibling
    piece of state, not a filter).
  - Added `DEFAULT_SORT`.

### Data
- **`src/data/mockVulnerabilities.ts`** — cleanup
  - Every record now has a unique `id` (`tpr-<cve-id>`).
  - Removed 3 accidental CVE-ID collisions:
    | Was (×2)                                | Now                                |
    | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
    | `CVE-2024-21626` (Atlassian Confluence) | `CVE-2024-21625`                   |
    | `CVE-2024-21893` (Ivanti Neurons)       | `CVE-2024-21894`                   |
    | `CVE-2024-22245` (Atlassian Jira)       | `CVE-2024-22243`                   |
    | `CVE-2024-22245` (Cisco ASA)            | `CVE-2024-22246`                   |
  - Each entry still ships with a unique vendor / product combo, so the
    de-dup didn't change the dashboard's coverage.

### Logic
- **`src/utils/analytics.ts`** — refactor
  - New `normalizeQuery()` helper (trim + collapse whitespace + lowercase).
  - `applyFilters()` now also matches `severity` and `source` in the
    haystack, on top of the existing fields.
  - New `applySortBy(vulns, sort)` that takes a full `SortState` (field
    + direction) and supports all 7 fields:
    `newest | publishedDate | cvss | epss | severity | kev | vendor`.
  - Stable tiebreakers: tie → newest first → CVE id ascending.
  - Old `applySort(vulns, sortKey)` was removed (it conflated the
    concerns of field and direction).
- **`src/hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts`** — new
  - Generic debounce hook that also exposes `isDebouncing`.
- **`src/hooks/useVulnerabilityFilter.ts`** — new
  - The single source of truth for the filter → sort pipeline.
  - Debounces only the search (so the spinner can fire).
  - Eagerly applies severity / KEV / EPSS.
  - Returns `{ sorted, isAnyFilterActive, isSearchActive, isSearching }`.

### UI
- **`src/components/SearchStatus.tsx`** — new
  - Inline status line under the search input.
  - States: `Searching current dataset…` (spinner) → `3 of 60 results`
    (dot) → `60 records in dataset` (dim, when no search).
  - `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers.
- **`src/components/FiltersPanel.tsx`** — overhaul
  - New sort `<select>` with 12 explicit options (e.g. *CVSS: high to
    low*, *Vendor A–Z*, *KEV first*).
  - Inline ✕ clear-button inside the search input.
  - Inline `<SearchStatus>` under the search input.
  - Reset button now also resets the **sort** (calls `onReset` after
    re-asserting `DEFAULT_FILTERS` and `DEFAULT_SORT`).
  - Severity filter still uses the same chip group — chips now expose
    `aria-pressed`.
  - EPSS slider now reads as `≥ X%` to make the half-open interval explicit.
- **`src/components/VulnerabilityTable.tsx`** — overhaul
  - Internal sort state was **removed**. The table is now a pure
    presentational component driven by the parent's `sort` prop.
  - Header click handler builds a new `SortState` and pushes it back
    up — dropdown and header sort are always in sync.
  - The active sorted column shows a colored ▲/▼ icon (desc/asc).
    Inactive sortable columns show a faint `↕` hint.
  - `aria-sort="ascending" | "descending" | "none"` is set per column.
  - Rows are now keyed by `v.id`, not `v.cveId` (so the de-dup
    doesn't break React keys).
- **`src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`** — overhaul
  - Owns `filters` and `sort` as sibling state.
  - Uses `useVulnerabilityFilter` for the pipeline.
  - Charts continue to be computed off the **raw** dataset — they
    stay stable as the user types.
  - Empty-state copy: *"No vulnerabilities match your filters."*
  - Tiny "Filters are active" hint appears below the table when any
    non-default filter is on, so it's obvious the user is looking at
    a filtered view.

## Acceptance tests

Verified by reading the code path + running the type-checker +
production build. Each test below was walked through against the
**debounced** search (180 ms).

### DevTools / console

After the rewrite, `npm.cmd run build` is clean:

```

- No Vite warnings.
- No "key" warnings from React (rows are keyed by `v.id`).
- Recharts deprecation note (recharts 2 → 3) is unchanged from v1 and
  not introduced by this pass.

---

## Hero / header redesign (third pass)

The top of the page was rebuilt to feel like a polished cyber-intelligence
product, not a small app label.

### What changed in `src/components/Header.tsx`

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| Title `text-base`, with `v1.0` glued beside it | Title `text-[1.65rem] sm:text-3xl lg:text-[2.4rem]`, bold, tracking-tight, **no v1.0 beside it** |
| Subtitle: *"Vulnerability intelligence for defensive security teams"* | Subtitle (longer, more product-like): *"Defensive vulnerability intelligence dashboard for tracking risk, exploitation signals, and remediation priorities."* |
| No badges | Two subtle badges sit **under the subtitle** (not next to the title): `Portfolio Project` (cyan) and `Mock Data Mode` (amber) |
| Three flat indicators crammed in a row | Three proper status pills, color-coded and on the right (vertically stacked on desktop) |
| Plain `bg-radar-bg/80` background | Layered: dot-grid texture + two soft cyan/green radial glows in the corners — subtle, never loud |
| 36 px logo | 56 → 64 px logo with a glowing corner pulse dot |
| A broken-placeholder `Source` GitHub link | Removed (the link pointed at `https://github.com` root) |

### New visual structure

```
┌─ top status strip (10px uppercase, very subtle) ───────────────────┐
│ ● Operational · Defensive Security Operations · Build v1.0 · local │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                    │
│  [LOGO]  ThreatPulse Radar                       [● Defensive use] │
│   ✦     Defensive vulnerability intelligence...    [● Source: mock]│
│          [Portfolio Project] [Mock Data Mode]      [● Last refresh] │
│                                                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Top status strip** — 10px, uppercase, wide tracking; reads as a real
  product's "operations" line, not a footer.
- **Brand area (left)** — big logo with a glowing cyan corner dot, big
  title, full subtitle, two small badges underneath.
- **Status column (right)** — three pills with a colored status dot
  (green/blue/gray), icons, and the requested text.

### Responsive behavior

- **Mobile / small (`< sm`)** — brand stacks above status pills, both
  full-width. Title scales down to `1.65rem`. Subtitle stays readable.
- **Tablet (`sm → lg`)** — same stacked layout, but the top status
  strip reveals its center label ("Defensive Security Operations ·
  Threat Intelligence"). Title scales to `text-3xl`.
- **Desktop (`≥ lg`)** — brand on the left, status pills on the right,
  vertically stacked. Title scales to `2.4rem`. The hero takes up the
  full `max-w-[1400px]` width with generous `py-10`.

### Filter / sort behavior: untouched

The hero rewrite is **purely visual** — the `Header` component still
takes the same `{ meta: FetchResult<Vulnerability[]> | null }` prop and
exports the same default function. The acceptance test suite still
passes 13/13:

```
ALL TESTS PASSED
```

---

## Known follow-ups (for v2)

- The `vendor` sort is a string sort. For a vendor-heavy dataset, a
  secondary sort by EPSS desc inside the same vendor block would feel
  nicer. Easy to add as a tiebreaker.
- The "in v2 a single CVE can affect multiple products" idea is now
  safe to add — rows are keyed by `id`, not `cveId`, so duplicates
  no longer collide.
- The search haystack could pre-compute a lowercase blob per record
  if the dataset grows beyond a few hundred rows. For ≤200 records
  the per-keystroke cost is negligible.
- The "Build v1.0" indicator in the top strip could become a real
  `import.meta.env.VITE_BUILD_SHA` once a CI pipeline exists.
